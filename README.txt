Port-Scan v0.1 BETA

This is a TCP port scanner that automatically tries ports 0 - 65,536. I am not a coder, and this is probably very ugly to most of you. :-)

What it does:
Uses 'while' to loop through ports, writing results to a file called "Results.csv". I am wanting to eventually get this to write to a database
of some sort, not sure which one yet.

How to use:
You will need Python 2.7 and the default libraries. Double click "port-scan.py", input the IP or website you want to test (www.sigwo.com). 
As of now, there is no verification of what is entered. 

On Windows, a cmd.exe window will appear, running the code through it. The lines are a way of showing it is still running and not hung.
